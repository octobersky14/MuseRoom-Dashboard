# MuseRoom Voice Agent

A modern voice-enabled web application that allows you to interact with Discord messages through AI voice commands. Built with React, Vite, and advanced voice recognition technology.

## Features

- üé§ **Voice Recognition**: Talk to the AI using your microphone
- üîä **Text-to-Speech**: AI responds with premium ElevenLabs voices or browser TTS
- üì° **Discord Integration**: Read and send summaries of Discord messages via n8n webhook
- üé® **Modern UI**: Beautiful, responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- üì± **Real-time Updates**: Live conversation history and message display
- üåì **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between themes
- ‚ö° **Fast Performance**: Built with Vite for optimal development experience

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom animations
- **Voice**: Web Speech API + ElevenLabs AI voices (elevenlabs-js v1.2.6)
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives
- **Animation**: Framer Motion
- **HTTP Client**: Axios and Fetch API
- **Discord Integration**: n8n webhook automation with OpenAI analysis

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Create environment file**:

   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Voice Commands

The AI agent understands various voice commands:

- **"Read latest Discord messages"** - Fetches and reads recent messages
- **"Send Discord summary"** - Sends a summary to your Discord channel
- **"Hello"** or **"Hi"** - Greet the AI assistant
- **"Help"** - Get information about available commands

## Discord Integration

The app integrates with Discord through an n8n webhook automation system:

- **Endpoint**: `https://hadleycarr04.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/discord-message`
- **Processing**: The n8n workflow handles AI analysis, Discord routing, and message formatting
- **Response**: Automated responses are processed through OpenAI and sent to appropriate Discord channels

### How It Works

1. **Voice Input**: User speaks a command (e.g., "Read latest Discord messages")
2. **Speech-to-Text**: Browser converts speech to text
3. **Webhook Call**: App sends the message to the n8n webhook
4. **AI Processing**: n8n uses OpenAI to analyze the request
5. **Discord Action**: Automated system reads/sends messages to Discord
6. **Response**: AI-generated response is returned to the user

### Request Format (As per Boss Specifications)

```json
{
  "message": "Read latest Discord messages",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "source": "voice_app"
}
```

### n8n Automation Workflow

The backend automation handles:

- ‚úÖ OpenAI Analysis of voice commands
- ‚úÖ Format AI Response for Discord
- ‚úÖ Validate Discord Message content
- ‚úÖ Route to appropriate Discord channels
- ‚úÖ Send messages to Discord
- ‚úÖ Handle success/error responses

## Key Components

### VoiceAgent

The main voice interface that handles:

- Speech recognition using Web Speech API
- Text-to-speech synthesis
- Discord webhook communication
- Conversation history management

### DiscordMessages

Displays Discord messages with:

- Real-time message fetching
- Channel filtering
- Message statistics
- Summary generation

## Browser Support

- **Chrome/Edge**: Full support (recommended)
- **Firefox**: Limited Web Speech API support
- **Safari**: Basic support

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file for additional configuration:

```env
# ElevenLabs API Configuration
# Get your API key from: https://elevenlabs.io/speech-synthesis
VITE_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Discord Webhook Configuration
VITE_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hadleycarr04.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/discord-message

# Application Configuration
VITE_APP_NAME=MuseRoom Voice Agent
VITE_APP_VERSION=1.0.0
```

### Setting up ElevenLabs

1. **Sign up** at [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/speech-synthesis)
2. **Get your API key** from the account dashboard
3. **Add the key** to your `.env` file as `VITE_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`
4. **Restart the development server** to apply changes

The app will automatically use ElevenLabs for high-quality AI voice synthesis when the API key is configured. If no key is provided, it falls back to the browser's built-in text-to-speech.

## Available Scripts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Microphone not working**: Ensure microphone permissions are granted
2. **Voice synthesis not working**: Check browser compatibility

- [ ] OpenAI GPT integration for smarter responses
- [ ] Multiple Discord server support
- [ ] Voice command customization
- [ ] Message filtering and search
- [ ] Offline mode support
